# Återvinn Stan / Recyle The City

Prototype for a mobile app called Återvinn Stan. The purpose of the app is to make it easy for people in cities to recycle garbage that they produce on the go. Like your take away coffee mug or plastic cutlery from your outdoor lunch.

A map shows you to your nearest city-recycle-station, and a search function will help you know how to sort your garbage if you're uncertain. There is also additional info and news in the Help-section.

The app was inspired by an [initiative by Stockolms Stad](http://www.stockholm.se/ByggBo/Avfall-och-atervinning/kallsortering/), who in recent years has made an effort to make people recycle in public areas.
